"LOOP" is the whole section of music that can be looped seamlessly.
"END" may optionally be played after the "LOOP" section, so the music won't have an abrupt ending.
"STANDARD" stands for a single file that may contain all of the segments aforementioned.
"LENGTH" is the "STANDARD" file length measured in hh:mm:ss.
"BPM" means Beats Per Minute, also known in music as tempo.
